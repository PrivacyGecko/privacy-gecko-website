feat: implement simplified product card design with subtle AI indicators

Redesigned product card UI to reduce visual clutter while maintaining
clarity about AI capabilities through targeted, subtle indicators.

## Changes

### ProductCard Component (/components/product/ProductCard.tsx)
- REMOVED: Large AI features section (lines 120-151) with gradient boxes
- CHANGED: "AI-Native" badge → "AI-Powered" badge with muted purple styling
  - bg-purple-600 → bg-purple-100 (light background)
  - text-white → text-purple-700 (readable dark purple)
  - border-purple-600 → border-purple-300 (subtle border)
- ADDED: Subtle AI indicator below CTA button (only for coming products)
  - Uses sparkle emoji (✨) instead of robot emoji (🤖)
  - Shows "AI-powered at launch (Q2 2026)" for AI-native products
  - Shows "AI features coming [date]" for post-launch AI products
- IMPROVED: CTA spacing with pt-4 padding for better visual prominence

### Homepage (/app/page.tsx)
- CHANGED: Display 4 features per card (up from 3)
  - Utilizes space freed by removing AI features section

## Impact on Products

### Live Products (Advisor, Share, Guard, Lock)
- NO AI-Powered badge (only for coming products)
- NO AI indicator (prevents misleading "coming soon" on live products)
- Clean focus on current features and CTAs
- Improved user clarity about product status

### Coming Products - AI-Native (GeckoView)
- Muted purple "AI-Powered" badge (subtle, professional)
- AI indicator: "✨ AI-powered at launch (Q2 2026)"
- Maintains distinction from non-AI products

### Coming Products - Post-Launch AI (Watch, Shell, VPN)
- NO AI-Powered badge (AI comes after product launch)
- AI indicator shows future timeline (Q1-Q4 2026, 2027)
- Clear expectation setting for users
