      - heading "Making Privacy Tools Accessible to Everyone" [level=1] [ref=e22]
      - paragraph [ref=e23]: "Privacy Gecko was founded with a simple mission: create privacy tools that actually work and don't require a PhD to use."
    - generic [ref=e27]:
      - heading "Our Story" [level=2] [ref=e28]
      - generic [ref=e29]:
        - paragraph [ref=e30]: "In 2024, privacy advocate @0xAnonA noticed a troubling trend: while privacy concerns were growing, the tools available were either too complex, too expensive, or worse—claiming to be private while secretly collecting user data."
        - paragraph [ref=e31]: "Privacy Gecko was born from a simple question: \"What if we built privacy tools that were actually private, genuinely useful, and accessible to everyone?\""
        - paragraph [ref=e32]: We started with GeckoAdvisor, a tool to help people understand their privacy posture. The response was overwhelming. People wanted more. So we built GeckoShare for encrypted file sharing, GeckoGuard for tracking protection, and we're not stopping there.
        - paragraph [ref=e33]: "Today, Privacy Gecko is an ecosystem of 8 tools (3 live, 5 coming soon) serving thousands of privacy-conscious users worldwide. We're open source, community-driven, and committed to our original mission: making privacy accessible."
